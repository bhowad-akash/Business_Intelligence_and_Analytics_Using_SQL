# üß† SQL-Based Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository presents a structured suite of SQL scripts developed to perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a data warehouse. Each script is purpose-built to examine specific dimensions of data, ranging from schema discovery to detailed performance ranking. This suite demonstrates best practices for deriving business insights from relational databases.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The analytical workflow is organized into the following key components:

### 1. `01_Database_Exploration.sql`
- Discovers database metadata using `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.
- Retrieves table structures, column details, and associated data types.
- Ideal for initial environment familiarization and schema auditing.

### 2. `02_Dimensions_Exploration.sql`
- Analyzes categorical attributes in dimension tables.
- Identifies distinct values for customer geographies and product hierarchies.
- Supports downstream segmentation and filtering logic.

### 3. `03_Date_Range_Exploration.sql`
- Evaluates the temporal scope of transactional and customer data.
- Calculates time ranges in years and months, and determines customer age distribution.
- Enables understanding of dataset longevity and customer demographics.

### 4. `04_Measures_Exploration.sql`
- Computes core business metrics such as total sales, average price, and unique customer counts.
- Offers a consolidated view of high-level key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Useful for executive summaries and baseline performance evaluations.

### 5. `05_Magnitude_Analysis.sql`
- Performs grouped aggregations across dimensions (e.g., country, category, gender).
- Assesses distribution and volume metrics like product count and revenue generation.
- Informs strategic prioritization and resource allocation.

### 6. `06_Ranking_Analysis.sql`
- Ranks products, subcategories, and customers based on performance metrics using window functions.
- Identifies top and bottom performers to highlight trends and outliers.
- Suitable for dashboarding, reporting, and targeted analysis.
